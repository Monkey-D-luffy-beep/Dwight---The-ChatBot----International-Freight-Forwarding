## Full Container Load (FCL) Shipping

### What is FCL?
FCL (Full Container Load) is a shipping method where the shipper bears the cost of the entire container unit, using it exclusively for a single shipment. You don't need to fill the container completely to book FCL.

### FCL Benefits
- **Enhanced Security:** Your cargo travels alone, reducing handling
- **Simplified Operations:** Direct loading and unloading
- **Faster Transit:** No consolidation/deconsolidation delays
- **Cost-Effective for Volume:** Better rates for larger shipments
- **Flexibility:** Choose container size based on your needs

### Container Types Available

| Container | Size | Capacity | Best For |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| 20' Standard | 20 feet | ~28 CBM | General cargo, heavy goods |
| 40' Standard | 40 feet | ~56 CBM | Voluminous general cargo |
| 40' High Cube | 40 feet | ~68 CBM | Light, voluminous goods |
| Reefer | 20'/40' | Varies | Temperature-sensitive cargo |
| Open Top | 20'/40' | Varies | Oversized height cargo |

## Less than Container Load (LCL) Shipping

### What is LCL?
LCL (Less than Container Load) is used for cargo that isn't large enough to fill a full shipping container. Your cargo is consolidated with other shipments to share container space, making it cost-effective for smaller volumes.

### LCL Benefits
- **Cost Savings:** Pay only for space you use
- **Flexibility:** Ship smaller quantities as needed
- **Access to All Destinations:** Same reach as FCL
- **Regular Sailing Schedules:** Frequent consolidation services

### LCL Process
1. **Booking:** Submit cargo details and requirements
2. **Cargo Receipt:** Deliver cargo to CFS (Container Freight Station)
3. **Consolidation:** Cargo grouped with other shipments
4. **Shipping:** Container moves to destination
5. **Deconsolidation:** Cargo separated at destination CFS
6. **Delivery:** Cargo delivered to consignee

### Why Tiger Logistics LCL?
- Expert team for all trade lanes
- Live tracking capabilities
- Transparent pricing
- Global network of partners
