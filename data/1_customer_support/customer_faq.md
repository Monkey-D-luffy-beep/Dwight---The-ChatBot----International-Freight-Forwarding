## Shipping Services

### Q: What shipping services does Tiger Logistics offer?
**A:** We offer comprehensive logistics solutions including:
1. **FCL Shipping** - Full Container Load for exclusive container use
2. **LCL Shipping** - Less than Container Load for smaller cargo
3. **Air Freight** - Time-sensitive and urgent cargo via air
4. **Cold Chain Logistics** - Temperature-controlled transportation
5. **Project & Defence Logistics** - Heavy-lift and oversized cargo
6. **Customs Clearance** - Documentation and compliance services

### Q: What is FCL shipping?
**A:** FCL (Full Container Load) is a freight term where the shipper bears the cost of the entire container, using it exclusively for a single shipment. You don't need to have enough goods to fill the container completely. FCL offers enhanced security and simplifies operations.

### Q: What is LCL shipping?
**A:** LCL (Less than Container Load) is used for cargo that isn't large enough to fill a full 20ft or 40ft shipping container. Your cargo is grouped with other shipments to share container space, making it cost-effective for smaller volumes.

### Q: When should I choose FCL over LCL?
**A:** Consider FCL when:
- Your cargo fills a significant portion of a container
- You need enhanced security and dedicated space
- You want simpler operations and handling
- Time is critical (no consolidation delays)

Consider LCL when:
- Your cargo volume is small
- Cost efficiency is a priority
- You don't need the entire container space
